\section{Identification w.r.t "utility shifting"}
\label{app:utilityshifting}
In the nested logit the equations in \eqref{eq:utilityshifting} are independent and can therefore be solved one by one. We can show that there is a utility shifting potential, where utility is subtracted in the nest, and added in the nest-children in the ACS'es $\psi$ by
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    V_m^{\psi} &= W_m - \psi + \frac{1}{\mu_m} \ln \sum_{j\in \mathcal{C}_m} e^{\mu_m V_j + \psi} \\
    & = W_m - \psi + \frac{1}{\mu_m} \ln \sum_{j\in \mathcal{C}_m} e^{\mu_m (V_j + \psi)} \\
    &=  W_m - \psi + \frac{1}{\mu_m} \ln e^{\mu_m \psi} \sum_{j\in \mathcal{C}_m} e^{\mu_m V_j} \\
    &= W_m - \psi + \psi + \frac{1}{\mu_m} \ln \sum_{j\in \mathcal{C}_m} e^{\mu_m V_j} \\
    &= V_m
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

In a similar fashion we can show that this problem also exists when considering scaling the $\beta$'s in $V_i$. This is omitted for brevity but follows the exact same lines as the above.

In order to solve this issue in the NL model, all nests should therefore have their ACS restricted to a fixed value, such as $0$.
